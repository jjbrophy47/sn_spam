## Reasoning Engines ##

* *PSL*: Probabilistic Soft Logic is a templating language to create hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs) using first order logical rules. A relaxation of boolean connectives allows continuous values between 0 and 1, providing efficient convex optimization over the objective function. Please visit the [PSL homepage](https://github.com/linqs/psl) for more information.

* *Tuffy*: A Markov logic network (MLN) implementation written in Java that uses PostgreSQL. Please visit the [Tuffy homepage](http://i.stanford.edu/hazy/tuffy/) for more information.
